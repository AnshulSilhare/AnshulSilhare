# Hi, I'm Anshul Silhare! 👋
### Operations & Supply Chain Analyst | Data-Driven Strategist

I am a **PGDM Candidate in Research & Business Analytics** at WeSchool ('27) with a background in **Biotechnology**. I pivoted from the lab to the boardroom because I realized I enjoyed analyzing the data more than performing the experiments.

Today, I apply that same **scientific rigor** (Hypothesis → Data Collection → Analysis) to solve business problems—treating supply chains as complex organisms that need optimization, not just management.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🚚 [Logistics Network Design: 2-Day Delivery Optimization](#)
*Strategic network analysis to achieve 90% US coverage within 48 hours.*
- **Objective:** Designed a "Lean 5-Node" distribution network (Redlands, Robbinsville, Louisville, Coppell, Lakeland) to balance freight costs vs. speed.
- **Methodology:** Conducted **Transit Time Analysis** and economic modeling to justify fixed asset allocation.
- **Outcome:** Validated 100% target city coverage while minimizing capital expansion.

### 📉 [Pharma Demand Forecasting: Statistical Model Selection](#)
*Matching the math to the market behavior for a multi-product portfolio.*
- **Problem:** High volatility in "Product A" vs. stable demand in "Product B" required different forecasting engines.
- **Analysis:**
    - **High Volatility:** Applied **Exponential Smoothing (Alpha = 0.5)** to react instantly to demand surges.
    - **Stable Demand:** Applied **Moving Averages** to filter daily noise.
- **Impact:** Reduced procurement lag and optimized safety stock levels to prevent stockouts.

### 🏭 [Warehouse Layout Optimization: Flow Engineering](#)
*Redesigning facility layout to resolve bottlenecks.*
- **Strategy:** Implemented "Cross-Dock" style conveyor systems and segregated Inbound/Outbound zones.
- **Result:** Theoretically increased throughput capacity by **20%** by minimizing picker travel distance.

### 🏥 [Medical Device Value Stream Mapping](#)
*Visualizing the gap between planning and reality.*
- **Analysis:** Mapped the "Current State" flow using Lucidchart, revealing a **96+ hour delay** between assembly and sterilization.
- **Key Finding:** Identified "Trunk Stock" (hidden inventory) carried by sales reps that was skewing central planning data.
